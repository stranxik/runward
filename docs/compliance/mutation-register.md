# Mutation survivor register

Every mutant that runward's own test net fails to kill, filed with what it actually is.

This document exists because of [ADR-0046](../adr/ADR-0046-mutation-testing-is-an-instrument-not-a-gate.md),
which made mutation testing an instrument and set two obligations that only a committed artifact can
carry: decision 2 makes the survivor list a ratchet — *"the score does not go down and the absolute
survivor list does not grow"* — and decision 4 says each survivor is **filed**, not queued, because a
survivor is not automatically a defect.

Until 2026-08-19 the list existed only as counts inside that ADR. A ratchet nobody can diff is not a
ratchet, so the list is now produced from a real measurement, by
[`scripts/mutation-survivors.mjs`](../../scripts/mutation-survivors.mjs), and never typed by hand.

## What this is not

It is not a backlog to drive to zero, and it is not a score. ADR-0046 decision 1 refuses an absolute
threshold: a mutation score written into a manifest would be a verdict satisfied by a figure nobody
re-derived, which [ADR-0045](../adr/ADR-0045-the-gate-cannot-be-satisfied-by-paperwork.md) forbids.
runward does not do to itself what it refuses from an operator. Nothing in this file is read by
`runward check`, and no CI job fails on it.

## Method

Two passes, in this order. The second one is not optional, and it is the reason the numbers here are
smaller than a raw Stryker report.

**Pass 1 — the unit suite.** `scripts/mutation-chunked.sh <module> <lines>` runs Stryker in resumable
line-range chunks. What survives is a mutant `node --test` did not kill.

**Pass 2 — the whole net.** ADR-0046 decision 2: the unit suite is not runward's safety net. In
August, 433 mutants survived the unit suite and **53 of them died** against the self-gate, the OSCAL
schema validation and the end-to-end smoke. Reporting those 53 as holes would have been false.
[`scripts/mutation-wholenet.mjs`](../../scripts/mutation-wholenet.mjs) re-runs each survivor against
that net and records which leg caught it.

Both passes *apply the mutant and read a verdict*. ADR-0046 decision 3 requires it: on an earlier
bench of four, three survivors declared harmless by reading the code were live defects. Reasoning
about a mutant is not evidence about a mutant.

## The four filings

| Filing | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `hole` | Nothing catches it and it changes a verdict. It gets an `RWD-` entry in [known-defects.md](known-defects.md) and a test. This is the only filing that creates work. |
| `defence-in-depth` | The unit suite misses it, another leg of the net catches it. Named with the leg that caught it. |
| `equivalent` | The mutant cannot change behaviour. **The argument is written out**, never assumed — this is the filing that was wrong three times out of four on the August bench. |
| `display-only` | It changes printed prose and nothing else. ADR-0046 decision 1: no test should pin prose. |

## Reproducing

```
npm run build
scripts/mutation-chunked.sh evidence 808          # pass 1, resumable
node scripts/mutation-survivors.mjs --chunks evidence --emit-merged reports/mutation/evidence.json
node scripts/mutation-wholenet.mjs --report reports/mutation/evidence.json --module evidence
```

A full pass over the eleven modules is an overnight, before-a-release job — 4250 mutants against a
47-second suite. `stryker.config.json` documents the measured cost, the levers that make it
affordable as the perimeter grows, and one lever that was tried and produces a fictional score.

## Perimeter, with its absences

Stated first, per ADR-0046 decision 5. The measurement covers library modules. It does **not** cover
`src/commands/check.ts`, where the verdict is assembled and the exit code is chosen: no unit test
imports a command, so mutating one would report 100 % survivors, which is noise rather than a
measurement. Pass 2 partially answers for those lines — the self-gate runs the real command — but a
mutant there is not counted here, and saying otherwise would be the overclaim this project refuses.

<!-- Module sections follow, each headed `## Module: <name>` — the marker is explicit so that the
     single-word headings above (Method, Reproducing) are not read as modules. Each declares its
     survivor count on a `Survivors: N` line, which test/unit/mutation-register.test.js checks
     against the number of table rows: a count stated separately from the table is what catches
     rows silently dropped by an edit. -->

## Module: evidence

Survivors: 213

Holes: 144 · Equivalent: 43 · Display-only: 25 · Defence-in-depth: 1

Rows filed `hole`, `equivalent` or `display-only` survived the unit suite AND the whole net —
the self-gate, OSCAL validation, the smoke test, in-toto schema validation and the audit corpus.
Rows filed `defence-in-depth` survived the unit suite and were caught by one of those legs, so
something does watch them, just not the tests. They are listed rather than set aside: leaving them
out was a prose exception that made the ratchet report them as new survivors on every run.

The `Note` column is a summary. The full evidence for every verdict — what was run, what was
observed, and the argument for each equivalence — is in
[`mutation-survivors/`](mutation-survivors/), one file per function.
