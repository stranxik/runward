# Roadmap

Shipped work is recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). This file lists only what is ahead.

Last groomed: 2026-07-31 (v0.26.0) — a packaging test fails the build if this stamp lags the
package version, so this file can no longer rot silently (it had, from v0.14.2 to v0.21.0:
the floor-ts English pass and the documentation site were both long shipped and still listed).

## Next

- **Ratify or reject [ADR-0043](docs/adr/ADR-0043-territory-is-declared-in-two-parts.md) — territory declared in two parts.** A second field report measured the ceiling of the current carrier: **six of the 45 CRITICAL/HIGH rules declare a territory reaching the client's tree**, and it is terminal, not transitional (the editorial pass is complete; fifty rules have declared they will never carry one). The candidate splits the declaration — the rule names the category it governs and no path; which files are in that category is derived from what the project already declares, and completed by the mission where derivation cannot reach. Nothing is built: ratification first, then the category vocabulary and the first derivation adapter. **By 2026-12-01.**

## Watching

- **How the `--for` answer is read.** [ADR-0041](docs/adr/ADR-0041-rules-for-paths-declared-territory-with-a-named-match-reason.md)'s own reopening trigger (a): if the list is taken as exhaustive despite the standing caveat and the split counts, the output shape is wrong, not the operator.
- **Whether the two anchored `topology-*` rules pull their weight.** They were anchored to `execution-topology.md` because runward scaffolds that deliverable itself; if operators find the match noisy on a file that already carries four topology rules, the anchor is too coarse.
- **Rules whose `noTerritory` reason ages.** A declared absence is a decision, not a permanent fact: a rule rewritten to name an artifact becomes anchorable. Fifty of them now carry a reason that can be argued with — that is the point.

## Later

- Community workflow extensions
- More tool profiles (contributions welcome — see CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Legal review of the license split (tooling MIT / doctrine CC BY-ND)
- Submit the Claude Code plugin (runward-gate) to the official plugin directory
  (discoverability; the third-party marketplace channel already works)

## Someday

- Certification / training track (separate, commercial)
- Operator-layer satellite (adoption self-audit, operator cost recipes) — only on a real
  demand signal arriving through a channel (the ADR-0028 watch); never in the MIT CLI
  ([ADR-0039](docs/adr/ADR-0039-the-operator-layer-stays-outside-the-cli.md)). If the
  trigger ever fires, the citable reference frame exists: the AHE loop
  (observe/diagnose/propose/evaluate/promote under HITL) of arXiv 2605.18747 §2.3 —
  a frame, not a demand signal; the trigger stands unchanged
